# Release Strategy for Flow

This document outlines the release strategy, versioning scheme, and publication process for the Flow library.

## üè∑Ô∏è Semantic Versioning

Flow follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version (X.y.z): Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version (x.Y.z): New functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version (x.y.Z): Backwards compatible bug fixes

### Version Format
- **Stable releases**: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.0.1`
- **Pre-releases**: `v1.0.0-rc.1`, `v1.0.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-alpha.1`

## üìã Release Process

### 1. Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating any release:

- [ ] All tests pass (`go test -v -race ./...`)
- [ ] Code coverage is maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Examples work correctly
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] Version is bumped in relevant files

### 2. Release Types

#### Patch Release (v1.0.X)
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- No API changes

#### Minor Release (v1.X.0)
- New adaptive behaviors
- New parameters
- New utility functions
- Backwards compatible API additions

#### Major Release (vX.0.0)
- Breaking API changes
- Architectural changes
- Removal of deprecated features

### 3. Release Commands

Use the automated release script in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# 1. Create a patch release (bug fixes)
./scripts/release.sh patch

# 2. Create a minor release (new features)
./scripts/release.sh minor

# 3. Create a major release (breaking changes)
./scripts/release.sh major

# 4. Create a pre-release
./scripts/release.sh minor --pre-release rc

# 5. Preview changes (recommended first)
./scripts/release.sh --dry-run patch

# 6. Run only pre-release checks
./scripts/release.sh --check-only
```

The script automatically:
- Calculates the next version from git tags
- Validates all pre-release requirements
- Updates CHANGELOG.md with git commit messages
- Creates and pushes the git tag
- Triggers GitHub Actions for release creation

## üöÄ Publication Channels

### 2. Go Package Registry
- Automatic via go.mod and tags
